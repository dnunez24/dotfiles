## Secrets

### Environment Variables

Some secrets may need to be stored in environment variables to be loaded by the shell. You can add these to a file in `~/.config/fish/conf.d` which is not included here for reasons which should be obvious. The file name must end in `.fish`. You might name it something like `secrets.fish`.

### Other Files

Other secret files, like SSH private keys, must be copied over manually from wherever you're securely storing them. Place them in the appropriate folders.
